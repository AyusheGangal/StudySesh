##### <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Types of development:</mark>
1. Model-centric AI development
2. Data-centric AI development: Better for practical projects as it makes sure you're not only using the right model and architecture but feeding your algorithm high-quality data.

1. Because machine learning it's such an iterative process, being able to go through this development loop many times very quickly, is key to improving performance.
2. But one of the things that will help you improve performance is, each time through the loop, being able to make good choices about how to modify the data or how to modify the model or how to modify the hyper parameters. 
3. After you've done this enough times and achieve a good model, one last step that's often useful is to carry out a richer error analysis and have your system go through a final audit to make sure that it is working before you push it to a production deployment.

##### <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Key Challenges:</mark>
There are three key milestones that most projects should aspire to accomplish
1. Doing well on training set (usually measured by average training error)
2. Doing well on dev/ test set.
3. Doing well on business metrics/ project goals.
