Machine learning models are great, but unless you know how to put them into production, it's hard to get them to create the maximum amount of possible value.

## <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">MLOps Definition</mark>
MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) is an emerging discipline, and comprises a set of tools and principles to support progress through the ML project lifecycle.

<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Challenges for deploying ML models:</mark>
1. The dataset changes (data drift), and its difficult to keep addressing that change
2. A second challenge of deploying machine learning models andÂ production is that it takes a lot more than machine learning code. The gap between the Proof of Concept (POC) which is the code running in our local jupyter notebook and the production is shown in the diagram below![[Screenshot 2023-01-09 at 9.58.10 AM.png]]
