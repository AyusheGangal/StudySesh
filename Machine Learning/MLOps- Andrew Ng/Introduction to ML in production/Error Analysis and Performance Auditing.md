##### <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Useful metrics for each tag:</mark>
1. What fraction of errors have that tag?
2. Of all the data with that tag, what fraction (or %) is misclassified?
3. What fraction of all data has that tag?
4. How much room for improvement is there on data with that tag?

##### <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Prioritizing what to work on:</mark>
Decide on most important categories to work on, based on:
1. How much room for improvement there is?
2. How frequently that category appears?
3. How easy is to improve accuracy in that category?
4. How important it is to improve that category?

##### <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Adding/ improving data for specific categories:</mark>
For categories you want to prioritize:
1. Collect more data.
2. Use data augmentation to get more data.
3. Improve label accuracy/ data quality.
