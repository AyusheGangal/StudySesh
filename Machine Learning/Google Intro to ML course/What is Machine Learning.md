In basic terms, ML is the process of [[training]]  a piece of software, called a [[model]], to make useful [[predictions]] or generate content from data.

For example, suppose we wanted to create an app to predict rainfall. We could use either a traditional approach or an ML approach. Using a traditional approach, we'd create a physics-based representation of the Earth's atmosphere and surface, computing massive amounts of fluid dynamics equations. This is incredibly difficult.

Using an ML approach, we would give an ML model enormous amounts of weather data until the ML model eventually _learned_ the mathematical relationship between weather patterns that produce differing amounts of rain. We would then give the model the current weather data, and it would predict the amount of rain.

## Types of ML Systems

ML systems fall into one or more of the following categories based on how they learn to make predictions or generate content:

- Supervised learning
- Unsupervised learning
- Reinforcement learning
- Generative AI
