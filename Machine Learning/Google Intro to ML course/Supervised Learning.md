Supervised learning models (Training a [[model]] from [[features]] and their corresponding [[labels]]) can make predictions after seeing lots of data with the correct answers and then discovering the connections between the elements in the data that produce the correct answers. 

This is like a student learning new material by studying old exams that contain both questions and answers. Once the student has trained on enough old exams, the student is well prepared to take a new exam. 

These ML systems are "supervised" in the sense that a human gives the ML system data with the known correct results.

Two of the most common use cases for supervised learning are regression and classification.
