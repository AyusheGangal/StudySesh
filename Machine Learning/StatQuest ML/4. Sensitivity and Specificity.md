Continuing with the prev example of patients with and without heart disease

- Sensitivity tells us what percentage of patients with heart disease were correctly identified.

- Specificity tells us what percentage of patients without heart disease were correctly identified.

For example, for a case of Logistic regression: We have sensitivity and specificity values as,

### Comparing algorithms' performance using Sensitivity and Specificity

- Better Sensitivity tells us that an algorithm is better at correctly identifying positives, in this case, patients with heart disease.

- Better Specificity tells us that an algorithm is better at correctly identifying negatives, in this case, patients without heart disease.

- So the model is selected based on the requirements of the problem, for instance, LR is chosen if correctly identifying patients without heart disease (negative) is more important than correctly identifying patients with heart disease (positive).
- And alternatively, we would choose that RF if correctly identifying the patients with heart disease (positive) was more important than identifying patients without heart disease (negative).

### Calculating sensitivity and specificity for larger confusion matrix
- The big difference when calculating sensitivity and specificity for larger confusion matrices is that there are no single values that work for the entire matrix. 
- Instead we calculate a different sensitivity and specificity for each category.

Similarly, we will have to calculate separate sensitivity and specificity for "Gore Police" and "Cool as Ice" as well. Which will be calculated:
