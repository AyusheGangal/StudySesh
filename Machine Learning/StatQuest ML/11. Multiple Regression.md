Simple linear regression is just fitting a line to data, and we are interested in R$^2$ and p-value to evaluate how well that line fits the data.

Multiple linear regression involves fitting a plane or higher dimensional object to the data. Calculating R$^2$ is the exact same for both simple and multiple regression. 
For multiple regression, you adjust R$^2$ to compensate for the additional parameters in the equation.

Comparing simple and multiple regression tells us if its really worth the time and trouble to collect the Tail Length data because we will compare a fit without it (the simple regression) to a fit with it (multiple regression).

So when calculating F value, we replace sum of squares around the mean with sum of squares around simple regression, and replace p$_{mean}$ with p$_{simple}$

If the difference in R$^2$ values between simple and multiple regression is "big" and the p-values is "small", then adding Tail Length to the model is worth the trouble.
