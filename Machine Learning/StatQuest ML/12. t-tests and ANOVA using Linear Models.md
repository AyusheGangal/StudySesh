The goal of [[t-test]] is to compare the means and see if they are significantly different from each other. 

If the same method can calculate the p-values for a linear regression and t-test, then we can easily calculate p-values for more complicated situations.

### How to perform a t-test using a linear model:
1. ignore the x-axis and find the overall mean![[Screen Shot 2025-01-10 at 23.06.04 PM.png|500]]

2. Calculate Sum of Squared residuals around the mean or SS(mean)![[Screen Shot 2025-01-10 at 23.07.42 PM.png|500]]

3. Fit a line to the data (this is where we start caring about the x-axis)
	- to fit a least squares fit to the t-test, we start by just fitting a line to the control data.
	- We start by finding a least squares fit to the control data, and we will find that the mean is the least squared fit (here, 2.2)![[Screen Shot 2025-01-10 at 23.12.41 PM.png|500]]
	- Now we fit a line to the mutant data, where the least squares fit will be the mean of the mutant data. (here, 3.6)![[Screen Shot 2025-01-10 at 23.14.43 PM.png|500]]
	- Here, we have fit two lines to the data and we will combine these two lines into a single equation. ![[Screen Shot 2025-01-10 at 23.15.18 PM.png]]
		
		- This will make the steps for computing "F" the exact same for the regression and the t-test, which in turn, means a computer can do it automatically. The goal is to have a flexible way for a computer to solve this, and every other "least squares" based problem, without having to create a whole new method each time.
		
		- The equation for the first point of control data is $$y = 1\times 2.2 + 0 \times 3.6 + residual$$
			which translates to, 1 times the mean of the control data + 0 times the mean of the mutant data + the residual of that data point from the fit (which is the mean)
			
		- This can look strange, but it works for that point as coefficient of mutant data does not exist for a point belonging to the control data, therefore, 0 x 3.6
		
		- Doing this for all the point in control data where we multiply the mean of mutant data with 0, and for all the points in the mutant data where we multiply the mean of control data with 0, we will get: ![[Screen Shot 2025-01-10 at 23.29.17 PM.png|500]]
			- The residual values will vary depending on the position of the point with respect to the fit (which is the mean here)
		
		- A matrix of these 0's and 1's is called a [[Design Matrix]]. They function like on/off switches for the two means. ![[Screen Shot 2025-01-10 at 23.34.49 PM.png|400]]
		- The design matrix can be combined with an abstract version of the equation to represent a "fit" to the data.$$y = col 1\times 2.2 + col2 \times 3.6$$
			Where "col 1" turns the control mean on or off, and "col 2" turns the mutant mean on or off. 
			
			In practice, the role of each column in assumed, and the equation is written like:$$y = mean_{control} + mean_{mutant}$$ 
4. Calculate SS(mean), the sum of squared residuals around the fitted line(s)![[Screen Shot 2025-01-10 at 23.41.24 PM.png|500]]
	- Now that we have the SS(mean) and SS(fit), we calculate the F value![[Screen Shot 2025-01-10 at 23.42.52 PM.png|500]]
5. Using this F value, we can calculate the p-value.

### ANOVA
in this example, [[ANOVA]] will test if all 5 categories are the same.![[Screen Shot 2025-01-11 at 00.00.30 AM.png|500]]

1. We calculate the SS(mean)![[Screen Shot 2025-01-11 at 00.01.24 AM.png|500]]
	- y = mean expression -> p$_{mean}$ = 1
	
2. We calculate SS(fit): The equation for the fitted lines have 5 parameters, therefore, p$_{fit}$ = 5![[Screen Shot 2025-01-11 at 00.03.43 AM.png|500]]
	
	- The design matrix looks like this, one column per category:
		![[Screen Shot 2025-01-11 at 00.05.54 AM.png|200]]

3. We can use these SS(mean) and SS(fit) values to calculate F value and p-value![[Screen Shot 2025-01-11 at 00.08.03 AM.png|400]]
