Continuing with out example of medical data with some clinical measurements, we have to predict using machine learning methods if the patient will have a heart disease or not.

To know which algorithm to use, we start by dividing the data into:
- Training Data
- Testing Data
Then we train all of the methods we're interested in with the training data, and test each method on the testing set. 

Now, in order to summarize how each method performed on the testing data, we can create a confusion matrix for each method.
- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">The rows in a confusion matrix corresponds to what the machine learning algorithm predicted, and the columns correspond to the known truth</mark> ([[ground truth]])

- The top-left corner contains [[True Positives]], which are patients that had heart disease and were correctly identified by the algorithm.
- The bottom-right corner contains [[True Negatives]], which are patients that did not have heart disease and were correctly identified by the algorithm.
- The top-right corner contains[[ False Positives]], which are patients that do not have heart disease were predicted incorrectly to have heart disease by the algorithm.
- The bottom-left corner contains [[False Negatives]], which are patients that had heart disease but were incorrectly predicted as not having heart disease by the algorithm.

If the confusion matrices of algorithms are very similar and it gets difficult to choose which algorithm performs better, we can use more sophisticated metrics like [[Sensitivity]], [[Specificity]], [[ROC]] and [[AUC]], that can help us make a more informed decision. 

### More complicated confusion matrix
Given a dataset which answers whether people liked a set of movies or not, we have to predict which movie they will like from a set of movies (total 3 movies).

In this case, the confusion matrix will have 3 rows and 3 columns.

But just like before, the diagonal is where the machine learning algorithm did the right thing (predicted correctly), and everything else is where the algorithm messed up. 

- Ultimately, the size of the confusion matrix is determined by the number of things we want to predict.
	- In the first example, we were only trying to predict two things: if someone had heart disease or if they did not have heart disease. Therefore, the confusion matrix was 2x2.
	- In the second example, we were trying to predict which movie out of the 3 the person will like, therefore, the confusion matrix was 3x3.
