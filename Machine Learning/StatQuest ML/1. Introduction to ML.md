Given some data, we can make curve that fits that data and then can predict the outcome. This is an example of regression.![[Screen Shot 2024-12-19 at 21.42.07 PM.png|500]]

The black line is a type of machine learning because we can use it to make predictions.

In general, machine learning is all about making predictions and classifications. 

The original data is called [[Training Data]].

So the black dotted line is to fit the training data.

The green squiggle would be [[Overfitting]] the data.

The blue dots represent the [[Test Data]]. In ML, the goal is to predict on the testing data (new or never foreseen data). We use the testing data to compare the predictions made by the black line to the predictions made by the green squiggle.

$\therefore$ We learned that we use [[Test Data]] to evaluate ML methods. And that we should not be fooled by how well a ML method fits the training data (could be overfitting).

Fitting the training data well but making poor predictions is called [[Bias-Variance Tradeoff]].
