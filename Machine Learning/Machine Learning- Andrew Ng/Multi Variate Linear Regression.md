"Make Linear regression much faster, much powerful"

Using Multiple Features:
- Notation: 
	$x_j$ = $j^{th}$ feature
	$n$ = number of features
	$\vec{x}^{(i)}$ = features of $i^{th}$ training example
	$\vec{x}_{j} ^{(i)}$ = value of feature $j$ in the $i^{th}$ training example![[Screenshot 2022-12-27 at 2.25.58 AM.png]]

Writing the model equation:

>[!Definition of a model with n features]
>- where $\vec{w}$ is a vector $[w_1 w_2 w_3 ... w_n]$ (row vector)
>- $b$ is a number 
>- $\vec{w}$ and $b$ are parameters of the model
>- $\vec{X} = [X_1 X_2 X_3 ... X_n]$
