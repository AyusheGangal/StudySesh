Understanding the brain using computational models:
1. Descriptive models of the brain
	- How neurons respond to external stimuli and how do we describe this quantitatively with neural encoding model
	- How can we extract information from neurons (decoding)
	
2. Mechanistic models of brain cells and network
	- How can we stimulate the behavior of a single neuron on a computer
	- How do we stimulate the network of neurons
	
3. Interpretive (or Normative) models of the brain
	- Why do brain circuits operate the way they do?
	- What are the computational principles underlying their operation?

### By the end of the course:
1. Quantitatively describe what a biological data or network of neurons is doing given experimental data
2. Simulate on a computer the behavior of neurons and networks
3. Formulate computational principles underlying the operation of neurons and network in the brain
