According to Terry Sejnowski, who was one of the founding fathers of the field, <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">the goal of computation neuroscience is to explain in computational terms how brains generate behaviors. </mark>

Computational neuroscience provides tools and methods for "characterizing what nervous systems do, determining how they function, and understanding why they operate in particular ways"
- Descriptive models (What)
- Mechanistic models (How)
- Interpretive models (Why)

### Receptive Fields in Neuroscience
- Receptive fields are defined as the specific properties of sensory stimuli that elicit strong responses from neurons.
- Early experiments by Hubel and Wiesel demonstrated how visual stimuli affect brain cell responses, leading to the concept of receptive fields.

Now, they were interested in trying to understand the visual system of the cat. In order to do so, they implanted tiny electrodes, or tiny wires. Into the visual area of the cat's brain. So this is this an area that's in the very rear of the cat's brain and by using these electrodes, they were able to 
record some electrical signals from particular brain cells. 

So these electrical signals that they record are due to the output of the brain cells and these outputs are in the form of Tiny digital pulses. which are also called spikes or action potentials.

In order to get these cells to respond, they show different types of stimuli to the animal.

In the cat experiment conducted by Hubel and Wiesel, researchers aimed to understand the visual system of cats by recording the activity of neurons in the visual cortex. Here’s a breakdown of what happened:

Experiment Overview:
1. **Electrode Implantation**:
    - Tiny electrodes (wires) were implanted into the visual area of the cat's brain. This area is located at the back of the brain and is responsible for processing visual information.
    
2. **Stimulus Presentation**:
    - The researchers presented various visual stimuli to the cat, such as bars of light oriented at different angles. For example, they used a bar of light oriented at approximately 45 degrees.
    
3. **Recording Neuronal Activity**:
    - As the visual stimuli were shown, the electrodes recorded the electrical signals produced by the neurons. These signals are known as action potentials or "spikes," which occur when a neuron is activated.
    
4. **Conversion to Sound**:
    - To make the neuronal activity audible, Hubel and Wiesel converted the electrical signals into sound signals. This was done using a device that translated the frequency and intensity of the spikes into corresponding sounds.
    - The resulting sound allowed researchers to hear the responses of the neurons in real-time as the visual stimuli were presented.

Key Findings:
- The experiment revealed that specific neurons in the cat's visual cortex responded strongly to certain orientations of light (e.g., the 45-degree bar) while showing little to no response to other orientations or broad illumination.
- This led to the concept of receptive fields, which are the specific properties of sensory stimuli that elicit strong responses from neurons.

This experiment was pivotal in understanding how the brain processes visual information and laid the groundwork for further research in both neuroscience and computational models of vision.

> [!tip] Mathematical Representation
This describes a model of a specific neuron in a cat responding to visual stimuli. Which of the following functions most accurately depict the model we are talking about here? Remember: y = f(x) means that y is a function of (depends on) x:
Frequency of spikes = f(Light bar's orientation)

> [!Explanation]
> In computational terms, this model is defined by a function, which we can estimate mathematically. In this case, we are trying to estimate an encoding function - one which converts a stimulus into a neurological response. A greater response corresponds to more frequent "spikes" (also known as "action potentials") being generated by the cat's neuron. So the function we would estimate in this case is: Frequency of spikes = f(Light bar's orientation). We refer to the "receptive field" of a neuron as the particular orientation of a bar of light that produces the best response (that is, maximizes f(Light Bar's orientation)).

Examples of Receptive Fields
- Center-surround receptive fields in the retina respond to light spots in specific locations. Spot of light that turns on at a particular location on the retina.
- Oriented receptive fields in the primary visual cortex respond best to bars of light at certain angles, illustrating the complexity of visual processing in the brain.
