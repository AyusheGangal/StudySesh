The **descriptive model of receptive fields** focuses on characterizing how specific sensory stimuli elicit responses from neurons. Here’s a simplified breakdown of the concept:

Key Concepts of the Descriptive Model:
1. **Definition of Receptive Field**:
    - A receptive field is defined as the specific area or set of stimuli that a neuron responds to. It includes the properties of the stimulus that generate a strong response from that neuron.
    
2. **Example: Retinal Ganglion Cells**:
    - In the retina, certain neurons called **retinal ganglion cells** have receptive fields that can be studied to understand their responses to light.
    - For instance, a retinal ganglion cell may respond robustly when a spot of light is turned on in a specific location but may not respond when light is turned on in surrounding areas.
    
3. **Center-Surround Organization**:
    - Many receptive fields exhibit a **center-surround organization**:
        - **On-Center, Off-Surround**: The neuron responds strongly when light is turned on in the center of its receptive field and less so when light is turned on in the surrounding area.
        - **Off-Center, On-Surround**: Conversely, some neurons respond strongly when light is turned off in the center and when light is turned on in the surrounding area.
        
4. **Experimental Approach**:
    - To build a descriptive model, researchers can conduct experiments by flashing spots of light in different locations on the retina and recording the neuron's response.
    - By systematically varying the position and intensity of the light, they can map out the receptive field of the neuron.
    
5. **Importance**:
    - Understanding the descriptive model of receptive fields helps researchers characterize how visual information is processed in the brain.
    - It provides insights into how neurons encode information about the visual environment, which is crucial for developing computational models in fields like machine learning and artificial intelligence.

Summary:
The descriptive model of receptive fields allows scientists to systematically study and describe how neurons respond to specific stimuli, providing a foundation for understanding sensory processing in the brain.


Question: When a cell has an "on-center, off-surround" receptive field, which center is being referred to?
Answer: The center of the small patch of retina associated with the cell.
Options:
The center of the entire retina.
<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">The center of the small patch of retina associated with the cell.</mark>
The center of the visual field.
None of these.

Correct
Each cell tends to respond to light input in only a small area of the retina and visual field. An on-center, off-surround cell becomes more active when only the center of this area is illuminated and less active when the only edges of this area (the surround) are illuminated. Generally a cell is not affected much by input in far away areas of the retina (although recent studies have begun to show that some subtle long-range communication may exist).
### Cortical Receptive Fields
The information from the retina is passed on to a nucleus, called the Lateral Geniculate Nucleus or LGN. This in turn passes information to the Primary Visual Cortex (V1)

So, the first one likes a bright straight bar.
the second like a horizontal dark bar

We can quantify these using Reverse Correlation.

1. **Receptive Fields in the Retina**:
- **Center-Surround Organization**:
    - The receptive fields of retinal ganglion cells often exhibit a **center-surround organization**.
    - **On-Center, Off-Surround**: These cells respond strongly when light is presented in the center of their receptive field and less so when light is presented in the surrounding area.
    - **Off-Center, On-Surround**: Conversely, these cells respond strongly when light is turned off in the center and on in the surrounding area.
- **Focus on Light Intensity**:
    - The primary function of these receptive fields is to detect changes in light intensity and contrast, which is crucial for basic visual processing.

2. **Receptive Fields in the Primary Visual Cortex**:
- **Orientation Selectivity**:
    - Neurons in the primary visual cortex have receptive fields that are **orientation-focused**.
    - These neurons respond best to specific orientations of visual stimuli, such as bars or edges of light at particular angles (e.g., vertical, horizontal, or diagonal).
- **Complex Feature Detection**:
    - The orientation selectivity allows these neurons to detect more complex features of visual stimuli, contributing to the perception of shapes and patterns.

Summary:
- **Retinal Receptive Fields**: Centered and focused on light intensity and contrast, using a center-surround organization.
- **Primary Visual Cortex Receptive Fields**: Orientation-focused, responding to specific angles and patterns of light, allowing for more complex visual processing.

This progression from simple to complex receptive fields reflects the hierarchical nature of visual processing in the brain.
