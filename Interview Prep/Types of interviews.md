### ML Depth:

- ML depth interviews typically aim to measure the depth of your knowledge in both theoretical and practical machine learning, in particular in the area that you claim you have worked on. 

- Although this may sound scary at the beginning, this could be potentially one of the easiest rounds if you know well what you have worked on before. In other words, ML depth interviews typically focus on your previous ML related projects, but as deep as possible!

- Typically these sessions start with going through one of your past projects (which depending on the company, it could be either your or the interviewer's choice). It generally starts as a high level discussion, and the interviewer gradually dives deeper in one or multiple aspects of the project, sometimes until you get stuck.

- The best advice to prepare for this interview is to know the details of what you've worked on before (really well), even if it goes back to several years ago.

### ML Breadth (Fundamentals):

- This interview is intended to evaluate your general knowledge of ML concepts both from theoretical and practical perspectives. Unlike ML depth interviews, the breadth interviews tend to follow a pretty similar structure and coverage amongst different interviewers and interviewees.

- The best way to prepare for this interview is to review your notes from ML courses as well some high quality online courses and material.
