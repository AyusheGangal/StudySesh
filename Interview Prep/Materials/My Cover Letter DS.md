Subject: Cover Letter for position-name

Dear X,

My name is Ayushe Gangal, and I’m pursuing my Master of Science in Computer Science from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. I came across the job listing for position-name on LinkedIn and after **doing … insert why ** I believe that I’m a strong fit for the job. I am very much interested in this position and strongly feel that I have the exact skill set required for this opportunity

Having interned as a software developer and a data scientist for the summer and the following semester, I have developed a problem-solving “can-do” attitude in addition to the analytical skills which helped me ace my job. I am currently working as a data science intern for the Strategic Engineering team  at Waters Corp, where I’m responsible for the smooth rolling out of the first ever version of a Mass Spectrometry app using Python (pandas, numpy, tensorflow, streamlit). I even received the “Most Innovative” project award for the project, me and my team built for company Hackathon, and are now in the process of filing a patent for the same. I particularly received a lot of recognition for being a fast learner, always delivering before my deadlines, and being highly efficient and performing exceptionally well under work pressure.

I have handled huge amounts of data, both processed and unprocessed during my research assistantship in my undergrad, where I learnt scientific computing, created a dataset of my own for my undergraduate major project, deployed softwares and identified and fixed bugs, and even co-authored 8 research articles- with two being book chapters for IGI Global Publication, two International Conference papers, 3 International Journal articles and an Indian Patent as well. I’m proficient in technical as well as non-technical writing, and like to take up new challenges.

I strongly feel that I’ll be an asset to your team, and would be honored if I were to be considered for the same. Kindly reach out to me at +1 857-268-3868 and I’ll be glad to share more information.

  
Sincerely,
Ayushe Gangal
