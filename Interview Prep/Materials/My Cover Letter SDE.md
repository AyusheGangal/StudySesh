Subject: Cover Letter for position-name

Dear X,

My name is Ayushe Gangal, and I’m pursuing my Master of Science in Computer Science from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. I came across the job listing for position-name on LinkedIn and after **doing … insert why ** I believe that I’m a strong fit for the job. I am very much interested in this position and strongly feel that I have the exact skill set required for this opportunity

Having interned as a software developer and a data scientist for the summer and the following semester, I have developed a problem-solving “can-do” attitude in addition to the software skills which helped me ace my job. I am attentive to detail and am a firm believer that software should enhance the quality of life of its user, thus build quality software which can exceed user’s expectation.

During my previous role as a software developer intern at Waters Corp, I improved the usability of the core command line program of the legacy software. I also assisted in the successful migration of sensitive chormatogram data of all the client from the legacy software to a new and advanced platform for which I utilized EntityFramework to locally create a database and schema by integrating C# and SQL to keep track of the previous states of the analyzed data from a chromatogram. I particularly received a lot of recognition for being a fast learner, always delivering before my deadlines, and being highly efficient and performing exceptionally well under work pressure.

I’m proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, C++ and Java, and love to play around with algorithms, and develop new and exciting applications. I wrote a research paper “Recombinant Sort”, which combined the best features of counting sort, radix sort and bucket sort. The time complexity of this sort was computed to be O(n) for best, worst and average case scenarios. 

I strongly feel that I’ll be an asset to your team, and would be honored if I were to be considered for the same. Kindly reach out to me at +1 857-268-3868 and I’ll be glad to share more information.

  
Sincerely,
Ayushe Gangal
