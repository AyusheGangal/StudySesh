An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

## Solutions:
### 1. Sorting
- This method requires that we sort each and every element and then compare them
- Time complexity would be nlog(n) x m, if we have m elements of n length each, therefore, time complexity = O(m.n log(n))

### 2. Hash Map
- We create a Hash Map, whose keys will be the sorted word, and values will be all the words who are anagrams of the key
- Time complexity = O(m.n. log(m)) where we have m strings of length n each.

```Python
class Solution:
    def groupAnagrams(self, strs: List[str]) -> List[List[str]]:
        ans = {}
        for i in strs:
            word = str(sorted(i))
            if word in ans:
                ans[word].append(i)
            else:
                ans[word] = [i]
        return list(ans.values())
```
