                if '+' in a:
					# Split this part again into two parts - before and after + sign
					# and replace dots in the first part with nothing, i.e. remove them
					# then reconstruct mail address by adding @ and the second part
                    s.add(a.split('+')[0].replace('.', '') + '@' + b)
