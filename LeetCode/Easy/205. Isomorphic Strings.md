```python
class Solution:
    def isIsomorphic(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        zipped_set = set(zip(s, t))
        return len(zipped_set) == len(set(s)) == len(set(t))
```

Explanation:

	why using zip ?  
		=> zip function would pair the first item of first iterator (i.e `s` here) to the first item of second iterator (i.e `t` here). `set()` would remove duplicate items from the zipped tuple. It is like the first item of first iterator mapped to the first item of second iterator as it would in case of a hashtable or dictionary.  
		Understand using exmaples:

```python
# when strings ae isomorphic:
s = "egg"
t = "add"

zipped_set = {('e', 'a'), ('g', 'd')}
# now comparing their lengths when duplicacies are removed
return len(zipped_set) == len(set(s)) == len(set(d))
# return 2 == 2 == 2 -> True
```

```python
# when strings are not isomorphic:
s = "egk"
t = "add"

zipped_set = {('e', 'a'), ('g', 'd'), ('k', 'd')}
# now comparing their lengths when duplicacies are removed
return len(zipped_set) == len(set(s)) == len(set(d))
# return 3 == 3 == 2 -> False
```
