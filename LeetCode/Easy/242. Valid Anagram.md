Two strings "s" and "t" are anagrams of each other if using all the characters of the string "s", we can create the string "t". That means, they are made up of the exact same list of characters.

## Solutions:

## 1. Sorting (best sol for space complexity)
- This is the easiest solution
- It involves 
	- First comparing if the length of the two strings is equal
	- If the length is equal, we compare the sorted strings
- The time complexity is high as we sort both the strings = O(n log(n) + m log(m))
- Space complexity is O(1) or O(n+m) depending on the sorting algorithm

```Python
class Solution:
    def isAnagram(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        return sorted(s) == sorted(t)
```

### 2. Hash Map
For example, 
let s = "anagram" and t = "nagaram"
- We measure if the strings are the same length or not.
- if they are:
	- We use a hash map to store the characters, and the occurrence of each character. (if we see a character, we increment the value of it in the hash map) 
	- We can then go through the keys, an compare that the counts for each character are the exact same or not. 
- If they are not the same length:
	- Not an anagram automatically

- Time complexity = O(n) instead of O(s+t)
- Space complexity = O(s + t)

```Python
class Solution:
    def isAnagram(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        if len(s) != len(t):
            return False
            
        countS, countT = {}, {}
        
        for i in range(len(s)):
            countS[s[i]] = 1 + countS.get(s[i], 0)
            countT[t[i]] = 1 + countT.get(t[i], 0)
        return countS == countT
```

- We use .get() to avoid the key error, in case the key is not present in the hashmap.

### 3. Cheat Solution using Counter()
- In python, we can use "Counter()" to count the occurrences of the characters.
- So we can directly use that and compare using == but will mostly not be allowed.

```Python
class Solution:
    def isAnagram(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
	    return Counter(s) == Counter(t)
```

- Time complexity = O(n) instead of O(s+t)
- Space complexity = O(s + t)
