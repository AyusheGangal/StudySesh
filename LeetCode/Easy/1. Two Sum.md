## Solutions:
### 1. Brute Force
- Using loops to go through every element and summing it up to see if target value is achieved.
- Time Complexity = O(n$^2$)
- Space complexity = O(1)

```Python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            for j in range(i+1, len(nums)):
                if nums[i] + nums[j] == target:
                    return [i,j]
```


### 2. Hash Map
- The approach uses a hash map to store the indices of the complements (target minus the current number) as we iterate through the list. 
- For each number, we check if it is a complement of any previously seen number, indicating that we have found the two numbers that add up to the target. 
- This allows us to find the solution in a single pass through the list.

```Python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        result={}
        for i,num in enumerate(nums):
            compliment=target-num
            if compliment in result:
                return [result[compliment],i]
            result[num]=i
```

**Complexity:**
- Time Complexity: O(n)  
    The algorithm iterates through the list nums once, making the time complexity linear with respect to the length of the list. Each lookup and insertion operation in the dictionary is O(1) on average.
- Space Complexity: O(n)  
    In the worst case, all elements in the list are stored in the dictionary complement_num_index_map, making the space complexity linear with respect to the length of the list.
