## Solution:

### 1. Brute Force

If we brute force this, we have to compare the first number with every element of the array, then do the same for the next one, and then next one, and so on.
- This will give us a time complexity of O(n$^2$) but we will not need any extra memory, so space complexity will be O(1).

### 2. Sorting
- This makes sure that if there are duplicates, they are adjacent to each other.
- So we only have to iterate through the array once, comparing two neighbors in the array, checking if they are duplicates.
- Sorting takes time complexity= O(n log(n)) which is a bottleneck in this solution; The space complexity will be O(1) as we are not creating any extra storage in memory.
- This is a slightly better solution than brute force, but if we use a little bit extra memory (kinda like a time-space complexity tradeoff), we can have a better time complexity.

### 3. Hash Set
- It will allow us to insert elements into the Hash Set in O(1) time, and to also check if a certain value exist in a Hash Sat already.
- Since each operation is just O(1), and we had to do this for n elements, the time complexity will be O(n), and the space complexity will be O(n) as the size of the Hash Set could be up to the size of the array.

## Code:
```Python
class Solution:
    def hasDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        hashSet = set()
        
        for num in nums:
            if num in hashSet:
                return True
            hashSet.add(num)
            
        return False
```
