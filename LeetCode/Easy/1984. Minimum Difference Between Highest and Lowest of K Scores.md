Sliding Window Algorithm:
1. It is essentially an algorithm where it allows us to look at a group of values that are between a starting and an ending index.
2. After analyzing a specific group of values, we can update the start and the end of the sliding window in order to analyze the next group of values
3. We can keep using the sliding window approach until we reach the end of input

Approach:
1. We know that we need to pick the scores from any k students from the array such that the difference between the highest and lowest scores of that k scores is minimized right?
2. The easiest way to achieve this is to sort the array, because in order for the difference btw the highest and lowest of k scores to be minimized, they need to be close together --> we can achieve this by sorting
3. Finally, we can use the sliding window technique to iterate over k scores, and keep sliding the window and analyzing k scores until the end of input is reached

Algorithm:
1. we sort the array
2. we initialize the start and end of the sliding window to be 0 and k
3. initialize the min we need to find to be a random large integer
4. While the end pointer hasn't reached the end of the input
5. calculate the difference between the highest and the lowest elements in the window   
6. If the difference is lower than the previous min difference, update the min difference
7. increment the start and end pointers to update the window
8. return the min difference


Solution:

```Python
class Solution:
    def minimumDifference(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        nums = sorted(nums)
        start, end = 0, k

        minDiff = float("inf")
        
        while end <= len(nums):
            diff = max(nums[start:end]) - min(nums[start:end])

            if diff < minDiff:
                minDiff = diff

            start+=1
            end+=1
        
        return minDiff
```
