Descriptive statistics means a way to summarize data with numbers and graphs to visualize information.

	When data is of large size, it becomes essential to use summaries.

## Graphical Summaries of Data
It is best to use a graphical summary to communicate information, because people prefer to look at pictures rather than at numbers.

There are many ways to visualize data. Which one to choose will depend on the nature of the data and the goal of the visualization. 

- Qualitative data (eg: colors, car types, ..) use a pie chart or dot plot
	- Here data is not numbers but categories
	- ![[Screen Shot 2025-01-11 at 17.15.29 PM.png|600]]
	- On the left, there's a pie chart that shows the geographic origin of students at a university on the west coast. The idea is that each slice of the pie is sliced according to the corresponding percentage. The right side shows the dot plot of the same data. The idea is that each horizontal line corresponds to one category. The position of the dot corresponds to the percentage. For example, if we look at Oregon, this dot corresponds roughly to 20 percent. Each of the two displays has some advantages and disadvantages. For example, if we want to compare two categories, it's easier to do that in the dot plot.
	
	The dot plot makes it easier to compare frequencies of various categories, while the pie chart allows more easily to eyeball what fraction of the total a category corresponds to.

- Quantitative Data (ie, numbers): we can use bar graph
	- Ordering and distance between the numbers of the number line convey important information.

	- Histogram:
		- allows us to use blocks with different widths, where the areas of the blocks are proportional to frequency.
			![[Screen Shot 2025-01-11 at 17.35.10 PM.png|400]]

		- The key point here is that the areas of the blocks are proportional to frequency. This means that the total area corresponds to 100 percent. For example, if were interested in figuring out what percentage of people fall in the age group from 60-80, then we are interested in the area of this block. 
		- Now, just looking at that picture, we see that this area is probably around one-seventh of the total area. And so, we can conclude that roughly 20 percent of the people fall into the range from 60-80. a
		- So the percentage falling into a block can be figured out without using a vertical scale, just using the fact that the total area has to be 100 percent.

	- Density Scale (vertical scale):
		- Sometimes it is useful to have a vertical scale.
		- Its unit is '% per unit', so in the above example the unit is % per year.
		- The reason is simple, as area of a block represents a %, and width times height is the areas. Here, the width is in years, therefore, the heigh is in % per year.
	
	- There are two kinds of information one can get from a histogram:
		- Density (crowding): The height of the bar tells you how many subjects there are for one unit on the horizontal scale. For example, if we look at the highest point in the histogram, which is around here, this corresponds to people of age 19. And looking at the vertical axis, we see that there are about four percent of all people in that age. In contrast, if we look at the block between 60 and 80, we see that the height of the block is maybe 0.007. That means about 0.7 percent of the subjects fall under each one year group in that age range.
		
		- Percentages (relative frequencies): Area of a block gives us the %. Area of a block is given by height times width. So, for example, if we want to figure out what percentage of people fall in the age range between 60 and 80, then the computation that we would make is, we would look at the width of the box, which is 20 years, multiplied by the height, which is 0.7 percent per year. And we would find that they are 14 percent of subjects falling in that range.

- Box Plot (box-and-whisker plot): The idea is that it visualizes five key numbers of the data.![[Screen Shot 2025-01-11 at 18.19.18 PM.png|400]]
	- A graphical representation used to summarize the distribution of a dataset. 
	- It displays the dataset's minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum values, providing a clear picture of its central tendency and variability. 
	- Box plots are particularly useful for identifying outliers and comparing distributions across multiple groups.
	
### Components of a Box Plot:
1. **Box**:
    - Represents the interquartile range (IQR), which is the range between the first quartile (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3).
    - The edges of the box are Q1 (25th percentile) and Q3 (75th percentile).
    - The line inside the box marks the **median** (50th percentile).
    
2. **Whiskers**:
    - Extend from the edges of the box to the minimum and maximum values within a certain range, typically calculated as:
        - Lower whisker: Q1−1.5×IQRQ1−1.5×IQR
        - Upper whisker: Q3+1.5×IQRQ3+1.5×IQR
        
3. **Outliers**:
    - Data points outside the whiskers are considered outliers and are plotted as individual dots or markers.
    
4. **Optional Notches**:
    - Some box plots have notches around the median. If the notches of two boxes do not overlap, it indicates a significant difference between the medians at a particular confidence level.

### How to Interpret a Box Plot:
- The width of the box (IQR) shows the spread of the middle 50% of the data.
- The whiskers indicate the range of the data, excluding outliers.
- The position of the median within the box provides insight into the dataset's skewness:
    - If the median is closer to Q1, the data is right-skewed.
    - If the median is closer to Q3, the data is left-skewed.

### Advantages of Box Plots:
- Summarizes a dataset's key characteristics at a glance.
- Identifies outliers easily.
- Facilitates comparisons between distributions across multiple groups. Can be used to compare multiple datasets together as it takes less space than a histogram.
- Unlike histograms, we do not need to find an interval width.

### Limitations:
- Does not show the exact distribution shape (e.g., multimodality or density).
- Does not display every data point in the dataset.

- Scatterplot
	- Used to depict data that come as pairs.
	- The scatter plot is very useful to visualize the relationship between two variables.
