Frequentists method uses the present information and a model to infer the problem, while the bayesian method uses the present information as well as the previous knowledge to solve a problem. 

### Bayesian Vs Frequentist Probability

The frequentist view relies on an infinite number of repetitions and the Bayesian view relies on an infinite number of initial conditions.

Example 1: flipping a coin
For frequentist approach: 
- we are interested in finding the relative frequency of head in long series of "identical" flips.
- Assumptions: 1. Data Vary. 2. Parameters are fixed

For Bayesian approach:
- P(h) = $\frac{Number of Heads}{Number of Possibilities}$
- where `Number of Possibilities` are equally likely.
- Data is fixed
- Parameters vary
- Here the probability represents some uncertainty.
