<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Marginal probability</mark> is a term used in probability theory and statistics to refer to the probability of an event occurring without taking into account the occurrence of another event.

More specifically, if we have a joint probability distribution for two or more random variables, the marginal probability distribution of one of the variables is obtained by summing or integrating the joint probability distribution over all possible values of the other variables. This gives the probability distribution of the one variable of interest, while ignoring the values of the other variables.

For example, if we have a joint probability distribution for the variables X and Y, the marginal probability distribution of X is obtained by summing the joint probability distribution over all possible values of Y. This gives us the probability distribution of X, while ignoring the values of Y. Similarly, the marginal probability distribution of Y is obtained by summing the joint probability distribution over all possible values of X.

Marginal probabilities are important because they allow us to study the behavior of individual random variables, even when they are part of a larger set of variables. They also allow us to compute the probabilities of events involving a single variable, without considering the other variables.

The probability earlier was multi-dimensional with dimensions Disease and Symptoms. and since now we have removed some of the dimensions, it is Marginal Probability. 

In general,
