In probability theory, a probability mass function (PMF) is a function that gives the probability of a discrete random variable taking a certain value. In other words, it is a function that maps each possible outcome of a random variable to its probability of occurrence.

The probability mass function is defined for discrete random variables, which are random variables that can only take on a countable number of possible values. The probability mass function is often denoted by P(X = x), where X is the random variable and x is the value that the random variable can take.

The probability mass function satisfies two properties:
1.  Non-negative: The probability mass function is always non-negative, which means that the probability of any value of the random variable is greater than or equal to zero.
2.  Summation: The sum of the probability mass function over all possible values of the random variable is equal to one.
The probability mass function is an important concept in probability theory because it provides a complete description of the probability distribution of a discrete random variable. It allows us to calculate the probabilities of specific outcomes and to make predictions about future events.

### <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Difference between PMF and PDF</mark>
The main difference between a Probability Mass Function (PMF) and a Probability Density Function (PDF) is the type of random variable that they describe.

A PMF is a function that describes the probability distribution of a discrete random variable. It gives the probability of the random variable taking a particular value, such as the probability of rolling a 1 on a six-sided die. The PMF is defined only for a finite or countably infinite set of possible values of the random variable. The PMF is a function of the discrete variable x, and its value P(X=x) gives the probability that the random variable X takes the value x.

On the other hand, a PDF is a function that describes the probability distribution of a continuous random variable. It gives the probability density of the random variable at a particular point, rather than the probability of taking a specific value. The PDF is defined for a continuous range of possible values of the random variable, and the area under the curve of the PDF gives the probability of the random variable taking a value within a certain interval. The PDF is a function of the continuous variable x, and its value f(x) gives the density of probability at the point x.

In summary, PMF is used to describe the probability distribution of a discrete random variable, while PDF is used to describe the probability distribution of a continuous random variable.
