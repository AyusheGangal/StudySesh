A histogram represents the population.

In statistics, **population** refers to the **entire group of individuals, items, or data points** that you want to study or draw conclusions about. It is the complete set of elements that share at least one characteristic or attribute of interest.

The mean and standard deviation of the normal curve are called "population parameters".
- **Population parameters** are numerical values that summarize characteristics or features of an entire population. 
- These parameters are fixed but often unknown because itâ€™s impractical to study the entire population. Instead, they are estimated using data from a sample.
- Therefore, we call the "mean", the "population mean" & the "standard deviation", the "population standard deviation".

If we had exponential data, the curve would fit something like this, and it is determined by a rate (here 0.1), and then it would be called the "population rate".

If the histogram looked like this, we would fit a "Gamma distribution". Since the shape of the gamma distribution is determined by two parameters, Shape (here 3) and Rate (here 0.3), then Shape and Rate will become "population Shape" and "population Rate"

Since it is impractical to measure every single one of the data points in a population, we _estimate_ population parameters using a relatively small sample. ![[Screen Shot 2024-12-28 at 21.16.08 PM.png|400]]
- So we will use these 5 measurements to estimate the population parameters.

>[!note]
>The reason we want to know the population parameters is to ensure that the results drawn from our experiment are reproducible. 

- The more data we have, the more confidence we can have in the accuracy of the estimates.
- Statisticians often calculate p-value and confidence intervals to quantify the confidence in the estimated parameters.

>[!Summary]
>- A population represents whatever unit it is you are measuring in something.
>- The parameters that determine how a distribution fits the population data are called "population parameters".
>- We rarely, if ever, have population data, so we alway estimate population parameters.
>- Along with that, we also calculate how much confidence we should have in those estimates.
>- Generally, the more data we have, the more confidence we have in the estimates.
>- By estimating the population parameters and quantifying our confidence in them, we can generate results that are reproducible in future experiments.
