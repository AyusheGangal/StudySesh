The curve tells us the same thing as the histogram.

- However the curve has a few advantages over the histogram:
	- For example, a scenario where we did not get a value for a bin in histogram, we cannot calculate the probability using the histogram, but can use the curve to calculate the probability. 
	- Another advantage is that the curve is not limited by the width of the bins.

	- Lastly, if we do not have enough measurements, the approximate curve (based on the mean and standard deviation of the data we do have), is usually good enough

>[!Example] Note
>Both the "histogram" and "curve" are distributions. They show us how the probabilities of the measurements are distributed.

- The tallest part on the curve or histogram shows the highest probability or where measurements are most likely.
- The low parts show where measurements are less likely.
