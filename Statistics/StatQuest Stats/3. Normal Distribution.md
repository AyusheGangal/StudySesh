Normal distribution or a Gaussian distribution, is called a "bell shaped curve" because it is a symmetrical curve that looks like a bell.
For example, the curve represents human height measurements.

- For instance, it is relatively rare to find someone super short
- But it is very common to find someone close to the average height.
- And its relatively rare to find someone super tall.

Just by looking at the graph, we can say that there is high probability that a newborn baby will be between 19 to 21 inches tall. In contrast, adults are between 60 to 80 inches tall.

The curve for babies is taller than curve for adults, this is because there are many more possibilities for adult height than for babies. The more options there are for height, the less likely any specific measurement will be one of them.

The width of the curve is defined by the [[Standard Deviation]].

- Babies have a small standard deviation, compared to adults.
- SD for babies = 0.6 & SD for adults = 4

>[! Note]
>Knowing the standard deviation is helpful because normal curves are drawn such that 95% of the measurements fall between +/- 2 standard deviations around the mean.

>[! Summary]
>To draw a normal distribution, you need:
>1. The average measurement. This tells you where the center of the curve is.
>2. The standard deviation of the measurements. This tells you how wide the curve should be. And the width of the curve determines how tall it is. The wider the curve, the shorter. The narrower the curve, the taller.

>The **Exponential Distribution** is widely used to model the time between two events in a process where events occur **continuously and independently at a constant rate** (i.e., a Poisson process).
