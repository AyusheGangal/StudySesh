Imagine if we measured the heights of a bunch of people:

- we have measured so many people that the dots have overlapped, and some of them are completely hidden now.
- We can solve this:

So instead of stacking measurements which are the exact same, we divide the range of values into bins, and stack the measurements that fall in the same bin.

- This gives a Histogram.
- The taller the stack within a bin, the more measurements we made that fall into that bin.

We can use Histograms to predict probability of getting future measurements.
- For example,

- Measurements here would be rarer and are less likely to happen in the future. ![[Screen Shot 2024-12-27 at 23.00.33 PM.png|400]]

If we want to use a "distribution" to approximate our data (or future measurements). Histograms are a good way to justify this decision.
- For example, normal distribution can be used here to approximate the data

- Here, if the data looks like this, we can use exponential distribution to approx. it

Figuring out how wide to make these bins is tricky.
