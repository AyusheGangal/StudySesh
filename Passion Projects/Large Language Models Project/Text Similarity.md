- **Similarity** is the distance between two vectors where the vector dimensions represent the features of two objects. 
- In simple terms, similarity is the measure of how different or alike two data objects are. If the distance is small, the objects are said to have a high degree of similarity and vice versa.
- Generally, it is measured in the range 0 to 1. This score in the range of [0, 1] is called the similarity score.
