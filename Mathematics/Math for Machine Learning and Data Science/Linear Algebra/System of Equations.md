Let x be apples and y be bananas, then,  
$x + y = 10$
$x + 2y = 12$ 
solving for $y$, we get $y$ = 2 and $x$ = 8

Let x be apples, y be bananas, and z be cherry, then, 
$x + y + z = 10$
$x + 2y + z = 15$
$x + y + 2z = 12$
By solving we get: $z$ = 2; $y$ = 5; $x$ = 3
This system is complete and non-singular.

Let x be apples and y be bananas, then,  
$x + y = 10$
$2x + 2y = 20$ 
This is redundant and cannot be solved as there is not enough information. This is a Singular system of equations.

Let x be apples and y be bananas, then,  
$x + y = 10$
$2x + 2y = 24$ 
This is contradictory information and cannot be solved. This is a Singular system of equations.

### Linear vs Non-Linear Equation
![[Screenshot 2024-08-31 at 10.32.26 PM.png|600]]

- variables a, b, c, etc. We're only allowed to have numbers or scalars attached to them. And there's also an extra number all by itself, like the 122.5 here allowed to be in the equation. 

- So in short, you can multiply the variable by scalars and then add them or subtract them, and then add a constant. 

- Non-linear equations can be much more complicated. They can have squares like a squared, b squared. They can have things like sine, cosine, tangent, arctan, anything like that, powers like b to the five. They can have powers like two to the a or three to the b. And furthermore, you can actually multiply the a's and b's. 

- In linear equations, you can only add them. But in a non-linear equation, you can have ab squared, b divided by a, 3 divided by b. Things like logarithms, anything along those lines.
