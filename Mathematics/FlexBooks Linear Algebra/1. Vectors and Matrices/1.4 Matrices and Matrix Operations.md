- A [[matrix]] is simply an $n$ x $m$ array of numbers.
- Matrices essentially can represent anything that can be stored in a grid. 
- Mathematically we are interested in matrices for reasons ranging from solving linear equations to probability theory to abstract algebra and group theory.

**Sum and Difference**: 
- To take the sum or the difference of any matrix is just to apply the operation to the corresponding entries of the matrix.
- These operations are only defined for matrices of the same dimensions.

**Matrix Scalar Multiplication**:
- Another operation defined on matrices is [[matrix scalar multiplication]], so given a matrix and a scalar constant, the product just has all of the entries of the matrix multiplied by the scalar.
$$3.\begin{bmatrix}-1 & 1\\2 & -5 \\ 4 & 0 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}-3 & 3\\6 & -15 \\ 12 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$$
**Matrix Multiplication:**
- [[Matrix multiplication]] is NOT COMMUTATIVE, so order of multiplication matters; 
- The[[ order]] of a matrix is a way to describe the size of a matrix. Order can be calculated by multiplying the number of rows and columns of a matrix.
- however, matrix multiplication is associative, so given three matrices $A \cdot B \neq B \cdot A$ but $A.(B.C) = (A.B).C$ 
- Also in order for matrix multiplication to work the number of columns in the first matrix must equal the number of rows in the second matrix. 
- An $(n×m)×(m×k)=(n×k)$ where that product is a matrix with the dimensions $n$ x $m$ times a matrix with the dimensions $m$ x $k$ yields a matrix with dimensions $n$ x $k$.
- We can define matrix multiplication as $(A \cdot B)_{ij}=A_i \cdot B_j$ where the dot is the dot product. So essentially the product matrix's entry of the i-th row and j-th column is the dot product of the first matrices' i-th column and the second matrices' j-th column.

**Identity Matrix**:
- An [[identity matrix]] is a matrix with 1's along the diagonal from the top left to the bottom right. The rest of the matrix has zeros everywhere else.
- The identity matrix is the matrix such that any matrix times the identity matrix is equal to that matrix.
- Form of identity matrix:![[Screen Shot 2024-12-10 at 22.34.14 PM.png]]

We have, $A \cdot I = I \cdot A$
$\implies$ We will get the identity matrix I when we take the product of the matrix A and its inverse $A^{-1}$.
$\therefore$ $A \cdot A^{-1} = I$ 

**Matrix Inverse**:
- [[Inverse]] functions are functions which undo each other, for example for $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, if $f(g(x)) = g(f(x)) = x$ then $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are inverse functions.
- We can define the inverse of a matrix as the matrix that multiplies a given matrix to yield the identity.

Here, the term $A = \frac{1}{ad-bc}$ is the determinant of the original matrix $A=\begin{bmatrix}a & b \\ c & d \end{bmatrix}$ 
The matrix $\begin{bmatrix}d & -b \\ -c & a \end{bmatrix}$  is called the adjugate or [[adjoint]] of the matrix A.
$$A^{-1} = \frac{1}{det A} adj(A)$$
**Determinant**: 
- The determinant is a single number descriptor of a square matrix. The determinant is computed from the entries of the matrix, and has many properties and interpretations explored in linear algebra.
- The determinant of a linearly dependent vector = 0
- The determinant tells us many different facts about matrices as well as linear transformations represented by matrices and can also be used to tell us about span and linear independence. It also represents the area of the object (parallelogram in 2 dimensions) created by the two vectors formed by the columns of the matrix.
- If the determinant of a matrix is 0 then the matrix has no inverse.
- if the matrix has no inverse then the columns are linearly dependent vectors. Looking at the two by two case you get that two vectors are linearly dependent if they are scalar multiples of each other and they are only scalar multiples of each other if
