Dot Product: 
- The dot product of two vectors is essentially a function that takes in two vectors and outputs a scalar. There are two definitions of a dot product, an algebraic definition and a geometric definition.

Geometrically, dot product of 2 vectors a and b is the scalar product of a, b, and cosine of angle between them. that is,

For example,
![[Screen Shot 2024-12-08 at 22.54.01 PM.png]]

- the cross product is perpendicular to both of the vectors. 
- geometrically speaking, that is the definition. The cross product of two vectors in 3-dimensional space is the vector that is perpendicular to both.
