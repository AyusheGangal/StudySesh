The **[[cofactor matrix]]** and the **[[adjoint]] (or adjugate) matrix** are fundamental concepts in linear algebra related to determinants and matrix inverses.

**Cofactor Matrix**: 
The cofactor of an element $a_{ij}$ in a matrix $A$ is defined as:$$Cofactor (a_{ij}) = (-1)^{i+j} det(M_{ij}) $$
Where:
- $M_{ij}$ is the [[minor]] of $a_{ij}$, obtained by deleting the $i^{th}$ row and $j^{th}$ column from $A$
- $(-1)^{i+j}$ introduces the appropriate sign (positive or negative) based on the position of the element.

Each cofactor tells us **how much a specific element of the matrix contributes to the determinant**.

The **cofactor matrix** of a square matrix $A$ is the matrix formed by replacing each element $a_{ij}$ with its cofactor:

For a 3x3 matrix, the signs of the cofactor will be:

**Adjoint Matrix**:
The adjoint or adjugate of a square matrix $A$ is the transpose of its cofactor matrix. $$Adj (A) = Cofactor Matrix (A)^T$$ This means you first compute the cofactor matrix of $A$ and then transpose it.


**Relationship between Adjoint, Cofactor and Determinant of a Matrix**:
The adjoint matrix is closely related to the inverse of a matrix. Specifically, for a square matrix $A$:$$A^{-1} = \frac{Adj(A)}{det(A)}$$If $det(A) \neq 0$
