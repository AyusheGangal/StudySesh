Â When we project one vector onto another, we extend the first vector and drop a perpendicular onto the line of the second vector in order to see what the image of the vector would look like if we placed it on the other vector.

projection vector is in the same dir as the vector it is projected on, which implies it will be a scalar multiple of that vector. It can be shorter or longer than the vector it is projected on, depending on how short or long that vector which is being projected is.
