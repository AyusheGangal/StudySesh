- A vector is a mathematical object with both length and direction. It is written as a coordinate and represented as an arrow, like a point.
- Vectors can be manipulated just like numbers can.

Vectors can also occupy n points in n-dimensional space where each entry has real coordinates. This means, that a vector can exist in a space with any number of dimensions, and each point in that space is described by real numbers.

- Now we can look at length or magnitude of a vector. From precalculus you probably know about the distance formula and pythagorean theorem so we can define magnitude of a vector that way.
- Magnitude is a scalar quantity that represents the length of a vector but not its direction.
- To compute the distance traveled in t amount of time on a curve defined by a parametric function F(t), use the following integral:

- We can see some similar proofs for higher-dimensions, but are less intuitive as the geometry is harder to visualize in dimensions above three.
