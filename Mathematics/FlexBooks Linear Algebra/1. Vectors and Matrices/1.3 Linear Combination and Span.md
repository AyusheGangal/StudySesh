Given two arbitrary vectors, $\overrightarrow{x}$ and $\overrightarrow{y}$ , and two arbitrary scalars $a$ and $b$, then we can write the linear combination of the two vectors as $a\overrightarrow{x} + b\overrightarrow{y}$ .

**Definition 1**: A linear combination of any set of vectors is a sum of scalar multiples of each of those vectors.

Here,$\overrightarrow{w}$ is not a linear combination of $\overrightarrow{x} + \overrightarrow{y}$ , or we can also say that it is not in the span of $\overrightarrow{x} + \overrightarrow{y}$ .

**Definition 2**: The span of a set of vectors is the set of all possible linear combinations of those vectors.

**Definition 3:** Linearly dependent vectors are vectors that can be expressed as a linear combination of each other. In other words, a set of vectors is linearly dependent if at least one vector in the set can be written as a combination of the others.

Formally, a set of vectors ${\{v_1,v_2,…,v_n\}}$  is **linearly dependent** if there exist scalars ${c_1,c_2,…,c_n}$ not all zero, such that:

$c_1v_1+c_2v_2+⋯+c_nv_n=0$ 

If no such scalars exist except $c_1 = c_2 = ⋯ = c_n=0$ , then the vectors are **linearly independent**.

Intuition: 
- If vectors are linearly dependent, one of them lies in the span of the others.
- If they are independent, none of the vectors can be expressed as a combination of the others.

**Examples**:

1. **Linearly Dependent Vectors**:
    - Vectors [2,4] and [1,2] in $\mathbb{R}^2$ are linearly dependent because: [2,4]=2⋅[1,2]
2. **Linearly Independent Vectors**:
    - Vectors [1,0] and [0,1]in $\mathbb{R}^2$ are linearly independent because neither can be expressed as a scalar multiple of the other.

#Important: When a set is linearly dependent there are redundant vectors in the set that do not help you span the space you are trying to span.

Therefor, for linearly dependent vectors, the sum of any scalar multiple is just another scalar multiple of that vector. To contrast this, a linearly independent set on the other hand is a set such that there exists no linear dependence relation. 

#Important:  $\therefore{}$ we conclude that in $\mathbb{R}^2$ a set of vectors is linearly independent if and only if:
- the vectors are not scalar multiples of each other, and
- there are only two vectors in the set.

if a set has more than two vectors and the first two vectors are not scalar multiples then the third vector has to be a linear combination of the first two.

Again, the same definitions hold in all n-dimensions, but here things get a bit harder

if you have two linearly independent vectors then all linear combinations must stay in the plane going through those two vectors and the origin. No vector can go outside of that plane because multiplying a vector by a scalar just keeps the new vector going in the same direction and then adding two vectors in the same plane stays in the same plane.

Food for thought question:
#question
Does a set of n linearly independent vectors spans all of $\mathbb{R}^n$ and what is the relationship between the number of vectors and dimension of the vectors implying whether or not a set is linearly independent or linearly dependent?

Answer:
Yes, a set of $n$ linearly independent vectors in $\mathbb{R}^n$ spans the entire space $\mathbb{R}^n$.
- A vector space's dimension is the maximum number of linearly independent vectors it can have.
- In $\mathbb{R}^n$, the dimension is $n$, meaning $n$ linearly independent vectors are sufficient to form a **basis** for the space.
- A basis spans the entire vector space, so every vector in $\mathbb{R}^n$ can be written as a linear combination of these $n$ independent vectors.

As for the relationship between the number of vectors and dimension of the scope, this relationship determines whether a set of vectors is linearly dependent or independent.

- If the number of vectors $k < n$:
    - In $\mathbb{R}^n$, $k$ vectors (where $k < n$) cannot span the whole space because there are not enough directions to cover $n$-dimensions.
    - These vectors can be linearly independent, but they only span a subspace of dimension $k$.
    
- If the number of vectors $k = n$:
    - $k$ vectors can span the entire space $\mathbb{R}^n$ if and only if they are linearly independent.
    - This set forms a basis for $\mathbb{R}^n$.
    
- If the number of vectors $k > n$:
    - In $\mathbb{R}^n$ any set of $k > n$ vectors is always linearly dependent.
    - This is because, in an $n$-dimensional space, there can be at most $n$ linearly independent directions. Any additional vectors must lie in the span of the first $n$.
