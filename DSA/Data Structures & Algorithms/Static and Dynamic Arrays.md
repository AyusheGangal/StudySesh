- Static array is a fixed length container containing n elements indexable from the position [0, n-1].
	- Indexable means that each slot/index in the array can be referenced with a number.

	- Access time is O(1) for both due to the fact that both are indexable.
- Array indexing is zero-based, meaning the first element is found at position zero.
