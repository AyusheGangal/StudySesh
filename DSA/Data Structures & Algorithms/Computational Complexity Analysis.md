To answer questions like:
1. "How much time does this algorithm need to finish"?
2. "How much space does this algorithm need for its computation"?

Standard way of talking about "How much time?" and "How much space?" is called the <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Big-O Notation</mark>
1. It gives the upper bound of the complexity in the worst case, helping to quantify performance  as the input size becomes arbitrarily large.
