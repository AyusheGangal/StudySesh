An input variable to a machine learning model. An [**example**](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary#example) consists of one or more features. For instance, suppose you are training a model to determine the influence of weather conditions on student test scores. The following table shows three examples, each of which contains three features and one label:

| Features    |          |          | Label      |
| ----------- | -------- | -------- | ---------- |
| Temperature | Humidity | Pressure | Test score |
| 15          | 47       | 998      | 92         |
| 19          | 34       | 1020     | 84         |
| 18          | 92       | 1012     | 87         |
